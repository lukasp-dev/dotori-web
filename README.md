## Why Dotori?

Navigating college admissions—especially abroad—can be stressful, confusing, and far too expensive.
Agencies charge steep fees for services as simple as essay review, leaving many students without affordable guidance.

**Dotori changes this.**
We provide **24/7 AI-powered essay feedback**, **resume-driven prompts**, and a **final human review**, all at a fair price.
Built by students, for students—because your story deserves to be written, not priced.

👉 원래 `Getting Started`는 프론트 기준 Next.js 설명인데, 지금 `Repositories`만 백엔드로 바꿔둔 상태야. 그대로 둘까, 아니면 `Getting Started`도 백엔드 세팅 방식(Maven/Spring Boot or FastAPI)으로 맞춰줄까?
